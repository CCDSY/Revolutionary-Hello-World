# Revolution
This program revolutionizes how *Hello World* programs should be written.

## How Is It Done?
It will create a project directory on your desktop, initialize an executable project using [*Swift Package Manager*](https://swift.org/package-manager/#example-usage), write a simple *Hello World* program in the project. Then, it will compile the project, then run the newly compiled executable with the arguments of the base program.
